      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.uh.edu/">University of Houston</a>, advised by <a href="https://shishirkshah.github.io/">Dr. Shihsir Shah</a> working at the
        intersection of applied machine learning, representation learning, and robustness
        for real-world, high-variability datasets.
      </p>
      <p>
        My research focuses on <b>data-centric AI</b>: understanding how data quality,
        distribution shift, and structural variability influence model behavior. I design
        experimental frameworks and learning strategies that improve generalization,
        stability, and interpretability of deep learning systems, particularly for
        imaging and perception problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have industry research experience at <a href="https://www.shell.us/">Shell</a>, where I built end-to-end ML pipelines,
        conducted controlled experiments, and translated model outputs into actionable
        decision-support tools.

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Data-Centric AI for Seismic Interpretation (EAGE)</h3>
        <p>
          Studied how seismic quality and label quality influence salt boundary segmentation
          under domain shift. Proposed evaluation-driven data selection strategies using
          image quality metrics and latent-space analysis to improve robustness across
          heterogeneous datasets.

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Autoencoder-Based Latent Space Filtering</h3>
        <p>
          Designed autoencoder models to learn compact latent representations of large-scale
          imaging datasets. Used latent-space structure to identify outliers, noisy samples,
          and underrepresented modes for improved training data selection.

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Continual Learning for Robust Segmentation</h3>
        <p>
          Investigated continual and incremental learning strategies to mitigate catastrophic
          forgetting when models are updated with new data distributions. Evaluated replay-
          and distillation-based approaches under realistic distribution shifts.
